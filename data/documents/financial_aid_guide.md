# Thrive Scholars Financial Aid Guide

## Understanding Financial Aid

Financial aid is money that helps pay for college. It can come from the federal government, state governments, colleges, and private organizations. Thrive Scholars provides comprehensive support to help you maximize your financial aid package.

## Types of Financial Aid

### Grants (Free Money!)
Grants do not need to be repaid. Common grants include:

- **Federal Pell Grant**: Up to $7,395 per year for students with exceptional financial need
- **Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG)**: $100 to $4,000 per year
- **State Grants**: Vary by state; check your state's higher education website
- **Institutional Grants**: Provided directly by your college based on need or merit

### Scholarships (Also Free Money!)
Like grants, scholarships don't need to be repaid:

- **Merit-based**: Awarded for academic, athletic, or artistic achievement
- **Need-based**: Awarded based on financial circumstances
- **Identity-based**: For specific groups (first-generation, minorities, etc.)
- **Major-specific**: For students in certain fields of study

### Work-Study
Federal Work-Study provides part-time jobs for students with financial need:
- Typically 10-15 hours per week
- Jobs are often on campus
- Earnings do not affect future financial aid eligibility

### Loans (Must Be Repaid)
Loans should be a last resort:

- **Federal Direct Subsidized Loans**: Interest-free while in school
- **Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loans**: Interest accrues during school
- **Parent PLUS Loans**: Parents borrow on behalf of students
- **Private Loans**: From banks or other lenders (often higher interest rates)

## Applying for Financial Aid

### FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid)
The FAFSA is required for all federal aid and most state/institutional aid.

**Key Dates:**
- Opens: October 1st each year
- Priority Deadline: Varies by school (often February-March)
- Final Deadline: June 30th

**What You'll Need:**
- Social Security number
- Driver's license (if applicable)
- Federal tax returns
- Bank statements
- Investment records

### CSS Profile
Many private colleges require the CSS Profile in addition to FAFSA.

**Key Information:**
- Opens: October 1st
- Fee: $25 for first school, $16 for each additional
- Fee waivers available for eligible students

## Understanding Your Financial Aid Award

- Personal expenses
- Transportation

### Expected Family Contribution (EFC)
- Calculated from FAFSA/CSS Profile
- Amount your family is expected to contribute
- COA minus EFC = Financial Need

### Comparing Aid Packages
When comparing schools, look at:
1. Net cost (COA minus total aid)
2. Amount of grants vs. loans
3. Renewable vs. one-time awards
4. Work-study opportunities

## Tips for Maximizing Aid

1. **Apply early** - Aid is often first-come, first-served
2. **Complete FAFSA accurately** - Errors can delay processing
3. **Apply to multiple scholarships** - Cast a wide net
4. **Appeal if necessary** - Contact financial aid offices if circumstances change
5. **Reapply annually** - Financial aid is not automatically renewed
